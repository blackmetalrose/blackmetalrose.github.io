                <p class="align-left">Hello, my name is Emily Yap and this is a new blog I've created! A little about me, I m studying Ecology and Zoology and I am currently working on my Masters project on the Little penguin in Aotearoa New Zealand. I grew up in Malaysia, the country of really good food and I love spending my time outside, painting with watercolour and eating fried chicken. </p>
<p>I started this blog with the intention to have a platform where I can share a bit of my research and my studies, but also to talk about different topics relating on conservation and the environment. The earth and the people on it are pretty important to me, and so I hope to share some of my thoughts and discoveries with you while I journey. </p>
